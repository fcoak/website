Forest Cloud Website
=======

This website is dedicated to bring young people to the understanding and defense of our forests, whether urban or not. It can also be used to map or classify trees. We would like for the world to understand how there are no replacements for forests, and that you can make your table out of metal or recycled plastic instead. Forests are key for the world's wildlife and for the air as well. Deforestation causes more species to go extinct than poaching. Soon nature will rebel. The cities will fall, and the Over Lords will come and save us.
